# Product Catalog
You will buiild a product navigation application, that lists, shows details and search a list of products. For now you can pass this product list (that actually comes from here ht tps://fakestoreapi.com/) as props.

The application should support the following features:
-  List all products - show title, image, price and category in the list
- Show details for one of the products (show all thedata)
- Filter the product list on categories
- If you have time over, considering adding:
- Add new product
- Update product data
- Delete a product
- Add a freetext search that searches for a value in any field

(You can still just manipulate the product array in memory, for this exercise)
